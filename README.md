# Casting Agency FSND

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Mysql

Follow instructions to install the latest version of mysql for your platform in the [mysql docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)


## Install dependencies of mysql for python

- `sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb`
- `sudo apt-get install python3.7-dev libmysqlclient-dev`


#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.


## Database Setup
With Mysql running, restore a database using the agency.sql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
mysql agency < agency.sql
```

## Running the server

From within the project directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql://admin:admin@localhost/agency
flask run
```
The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
